In this tutorial, you will learn how to embed multimedia content such as images, audio, and video in your HTML documents. HTML provides built-in elements such as `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>` to embed multimedia content in web pages. These elements allow you to display images, play audio, and video files directly in the browser without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

## Embedding Images in HTML

To embed images in your HTML document, you can use the `<img>` element. The `<img>` element allows you to display images in various formats such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc. Here's an example of how you can embed an image in your HTML document:

```html title="index.html"
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image Description">
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://.../index.html">
  ![Image Description](../images/assets/jpeg-image.jpg)
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, we have used the `<img>` element with the `src` attribute to specify the image file's URL and the `alt` attribute to provide a text description of the image. The `alt` attribute is used for accessibility purposes and is displayed if the image fails to load.

## Adding Audio in HTML

To add audio to your HTML document, you can use the `<audio>` element. The `<audio>` element allows you to embed audio files in various formats such as MP3, WAV, or OGG. Here's an example of how you can add audio to your HTML document:

```html title="index.html"
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
  <audio controls>
    <source src="/audio/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, we have used the `<audio>` element with the `controls` attribute, which adds audio controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) to the audio player. The `<source>` element is used to specify the audio file's source and its MIME type.

## Adding Video in HTML

To add video to your HTML document, you can use the `<video>` element. The `<video>` element allows you to embed video files in various formats such as MP4, WebM, or OGG. Here's an example of how you can add video to your HTML document:

```html title="index.html"
<video controls width="640" height="360">
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
```

<BrowserWindow url="http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html">
  <video controls className="w-full h-auto">
    <source src="/video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video element.
  </video>
</BrowserWindow>

In the example above, we have used the `<video>` element with the `controls` attribute, which adds video controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) to the video player. The `<source>` element is used to specify the video file's source and its MIME type.

## Adding Audio and Video with Multiple Sources

You can provide multiple sources for audio and video files using the `<source>` element. This allows the browser to choose the best source based on its compatibility. Here's an example of how you can provide multiple sources for audio and video files:

```html title="index.html"
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<video controls width="640" height="360">
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
```

In the example above, we have used the `<source>` element to provide multiple sources for audio and video files. The browser will choose the best source based on its compatibility with the user's device and browser. This ensures that the audio and video content can be played on a wide range of devices and browsers.
