##
SQL **Structured Query Language** is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete data in a structured format. SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. 


:::note
Key Features of SQL:
Data Querying: Retrieve data from one or more tables using commands like **SELECT**.

DML (Data Manupulation Language): Add, update, or delete records using **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE**.

DDL (Data Definition Language): Define database structures using **CREATE**, **ALTER**, and **DROP**.

DCL ( Data Control Language): Control access and permissions with **GRANT** and **REVOKE**.

TCL (Transactional Control Language): Involves **COMMIT** and **ROLLBACK**.

Let's talk about history of Storing Data, It's started with physical files and shelf. Then later on company started using Excel or Access. There is limitation for these tools when comes to high data volume. 

Then company started developing database management system like SQL, Postgres,MySQL.

> Databases are two types, SQL(Relational, Analytical OLAP) and NOSQL(key value, Graph, Document) mainly used for un-structured dataset. This NoSQL provides more flexibility over Relational as it dont have to follow schemas.

> Schema is named collection of tables, which can contains, views, index, datatypes, operators and functions.

1.  **Structure and Content**: In SQL, the structure refers to how data is organized in tables, and the content refers to the actual data stored within those tables.


| **Category**  | **Alias** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Tuple         | Row       | Record          |
| Attribute     | Col       | Field           |



    **For example, the following SAQl code creates a table named students**

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="Basic SQL">
       ```sql
       -- Create a table
        CREATE TABLE Students (

        );

      -- Insert a record
        INSERT INTO Students VALUES (1, 'Alice', 22);

      -- Query the table
        SELECT * FROM Students;

      -- Update a record
        UPDATE Students SET Age = 23 WHERE ID = 1;

      -- Delete a record
        DELETE FROM Students WHERE ID = 1;
       ```
       </TabItem>
       <TabItem value="Output">
       ```plaintext
       -- After creating the table and inserting a record:

       -- After updating the record:

       ```
       </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="DDL">
       ```sql

       DELETE FROM customers WHERE name = 'John Doe';
       ```
       </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="DCL">
       ```sql
       -- CREATE USER statement to create a new user account with specific permissions
       
       CREATE USER 'new_user' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
       GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON customers TO new_user;
       ```
       </TabItem>
       <TabItem value="TCL">
       ```sql

       BEGIN TRANSACTION;
       
       -- COMMIT statement to save changes made during a transaction
       COMMIT;
       
       -- ROLLBACK statement to undo changes made during a transaction
       ROLLBACK;

1.  Advantages: **Platform Independent?**: Yes and No — It Depends. The core SQL language (based on ANSI/ISO standards) is platform-independent, meaning the basic syntax and concepts—like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE—are the same across different database systems. ❌ But, SQL Implementations Are Not Fully Platform Independent:
   
Different Database Management Systems (DBMS)—like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite—extend SQL differently. They may:

- Use different data types (VARCHAR vs TEXT, etc.)
- Have custom functions and features
- Handle stored procedures, triggers, and syntax differently
- Offer different tools and performance optimizations
- So, SQL code written for one system may not work exactly the same on another without adjustments.

# 🗃️ Why Learn SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard language used to manage and query **relational databases** — the most common way data is stored across businesses.  Whether it's **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQL Server**, or **SQLite** — they all speak SQL! 💬

Data engineering is the process of collecting, transforming, and storing data in a way that allows for easy analysis and access. SQL is a critical tool in this process because it allows data engineers to:

1. ✅Retrieve data: SQL enables data engineers to retrieve specific data from a database by querying it based on certain criteria. This helps to ensure that data is accessible and easy to find.
2. ✅Manipulate data: SQL also enables data engineers to manipulate data within a database by adding, deleting, or updating data. This helps to ensure that data is accurate and up-to-date.
3. ✅Manage data: SQL enables data engineers to manage databases by creating tables, defining relationships between tables, and setting up security permissions. This helps to ensure that data is organized and secure.
