Inorder to create a project and host, the repository is a place where you add all your program code files and other documentation.

### Prerequisites

- 1. You should have a Github account 
- 2. Should have a basic understanding of how Git works/ and Git running in your OS.

    </BrowserWindow>
**Step 2:** Specify the name of the Project, make It public or private, for this tutorial you will make it public, Once the repository is gone private the project admin have to give permission or manually added other GitHub user to collaborate or make it visible. This is usual application in the organisation level. The next step check on the readme file, this allows you to create a ``readme.md`` file along with the repository creation. Then click on ``Create repository`` on the button below.
