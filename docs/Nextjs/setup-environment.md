## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Github is a way of version control your software development using Git, Github was founded in 2008 and recently Microsoft has bought the company now Microsoft is the parent organization of Github. So what do I mean by version control? When developing software the important hurdle is merging the version as part of development or update.

1. Get your username:

   Firstly, you have to enter the username, few usernames won’t be available, so try the combinations with hyphens to create a unique one, Enter the email address which may need to verify later. Then password and Bot verification as shown below. Once this is done Create account button below will be active. Click on that to proceed further.

     - **Live Server:** Launch a local development server with live reload feature.

     [![Visual Studio Code](./assets/image-2.png)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    </BrowserWindow>
        

     - **Prettier:** In the next, you can see few questions from GitHub to know about you. Once you are done filling those click on complete setup
          
   
    <BrowserWindow url="https://github.com/" bodyStyle={{padding: 0}}>

I would recommend skipping this step to proceed further.
