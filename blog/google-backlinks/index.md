## ⚙️ How does it work?

#### Backlinks promote your brand
They give more visibility for your internet presence just by being present. Backlinks allow your website and content to show on pages that are relevant to your sector, which helps you build brand awareness. As a result, your web traffic steadily grows, and you don’t have to put in as much effort to keep it up.

#### Backlinks boost your authority
The higher your website’s rating in relevant, organic search results, the more Google’s automated systems “respect” your authority. A high-quality backlink indicates to search engine crawlers that your online presence is genuine — that you are an expert in your field. This is the most important factor in Google’s assessment of your website’s authority, followed by registry listings.

#### Backlinks work well with social media
Backlinks are used in combination with social media marketing or social media management to encourage clients to establish their own brand reputation through social media. Because Google is emphasizing SEO on social media, your website’s authority in its industry will be viewed as greater by Google, resulting in more traffic.

## 🔄 Types of Backlinks

There are two types of backlinks generally – **Do-follow backlinks** and **No-follow backlinks**.

### ✅ Do-follow backlinks
Backlinks with a `dofollow` attribute pass the authority from the referring site to the linked site. Crawlers keep track of these connections and their anchor texts. As a result, dofollow backlinks have a direct impact on your backlink profile since they inform search engines about the connected website.

### 🚫 No-follow backlinks
Backlinks with a `nofollow` attribute do not pass the authority. Nofollow links do not convey authority or anchor text to Google. The links with the `rel="nofollow"` property in the HTML code are known as nofollow links.

> ⚠️ Always remember that although do-follow links can help you rank, no-follow links will offer you vital traffic and interaction, both of which are important in the realm of SEO.

## 📈 What impact do backlinks have on SEO?

Despite the fact that Google and other search engines are constantly updating their proprietary algorithms, the importance of link creation has not changed.

While Google has been coy about what it considers to be important ranking factors, it has stated that **links are a Top 3 ranking component**. Backlinks are frequently mentioned in industry research, with some claiming that they are the most essential component in search rank.

### 📌 Importance of Backlinks – Do backlinks still matter today?

Backlinks are important because they provide your site with **page and domain authority**, which may help you boost your search rankings. Just as we do when we’re making a decision in the real world, search engines look for evidence that they’ve found the right entity to satisfy the searcher’s needs.

### ✅ Yes, backlinks still matter today.

Nowadays the number of websites that link to a website still matters a lot (as of 2022, it is strongly correlated with high search rankings). The **quality** of the sites that link to you, on the other hand, is significantly more essential than the **quantity**.

> 📊 A link from a high-quality website like the *New York Times* is worth more than 50 links from unknown blogs.

In summary, the most efficient strategy to enhance your Google ranking for the phrases that your clients are currently searching for is to **gain high-quality backlinks**.

## 🌟 What makes High-Quality Backlinks?

To begin, you’ll need people to connect to your website in order to generate backlinks. Connecting to any website, on the other hand, may affect your SEO results, since Google may interpret it as spam and penalize your site as a consequence.
